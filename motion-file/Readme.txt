Other software was used for this task as open-sim did not have features to enable motion rendering. 
Used Blender 3D (open-source 3D software).In Blender, used a box that can follow the position data; then, fixed the wrist motion to the box,
and the rest of the arm joints will follow accordingly using built-in inverse kinematics. The data was converted to mot.file format thus obtaining motion for OpenSim; so created motion.
Note: This file is just an example. You can create a similar motion file using other software tools(CAD software, Blender 3D) to generate motion as
required
